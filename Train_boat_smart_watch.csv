Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 23 September 2022,"[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.",4,1
Nice watch,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 October 2022,"the watch was delivered on time. I am very happy with the watch. It has all the features. Like- sports, heart rate,sleep, weather ,call and music. But the reason why I gave 4 stars is,  In call feature the listener can just hear u can't hear what they speak And music doesn't work (speaker is not present). If this was given it would the best watch ever.",4,1
Very good product ❤️❤️,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 26 October 2022,A) The feel is very good.

Battery drains within 2 days......,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 October 2022,Pros. 1. Touch is awesome  2. Variety of watchfaces  3. Easy connectivity with app  4. U can listen music in watchCons : 1. Battery drains within 2 days  2. While walking it gives accurate results but while jogging a it lags 10% data and in cycling it d0 not count killometes  (if you cycle 10km it will count upto 400m,4,1
Overall decent watch,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 October 2022,"I got this for 1700 y all, it was worth it considering the metalic sides but plastic back and good watch faces but side bezels are noticable which i feel is a con and a little connectivity issue that i face sometimes. I will say if this costs over 2000 you might wanna consider some other watch but below 2000 totally worth it.",4,1

Activity reading is inaccurate,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2022,"I was travelling in bus, I recognised the watch calculating steps. I travelled for about 150 km in bus, and found that more than 10,000 steps were counted during journey. I understand that the road wasn’t good with path holes. But I found this to be very sensitive as it calculated huge number when I have actually not moved.Call quality, speaker is good. But UI seems to be very average, not so appealing. Even sleep tracking starts if you are just using phone before sleep and don’t move much.",3,0

budget BT calling smartwatch,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 6 September 2022,"This wave call Bluetooth smart watch is a budget friendly which is powered by 'Boat'. The main feature that I loved is its Bluetooth calling feature. The Bluetooth connectivity is like less than 3 seconds which is a bit faster. Although it is a LCD display it has high brightness and good display quality. The speakers are loud enough for my use. The heart rate sensor is accurate as expected. The build quality seems good and perfectly fitted to my hand. The UI is simple to use. Music controlling, Spo2 and so many sports modes are working fine. The battery backup given is 10 days, a good thing while travelling. And the boat wearables app is useful for a better customization of the smartwatch. Overall I simply like this wave call smartwatch and I would suggest who are searching for a budget friendly Bluetooth calling smartwatch, simply go for it.",4,0

An excellent watch with health monitoring and calling capabilities at a great price,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 26 October 2022,"There is no doubt that this is one of the finest smartwatches in the budget range.This watch has an ultra-slim body which is light in weight and gives a premium look. The seamless body and build quality are fantastic. The display on this smartwatch is amazing, and it works well both indoors and outdoors.Talking about its features, the call feature works decently and the mic and speaker quality is enhanced. Other features such as heart rate, blood oxygen level, and sleep monitor are also properly functioning. However, as they say in the description, this is not a medical grade smart watch. However, it is almost accurate in heart rate and spo2.Another thing that makes it so impressive is its battery life. It lasts up to 8-10 days without Bluetooth and up to 2-3 days with Bluetooth enabled. It was a surprise to see the quality of BT's calls. BT Calling stands out for its price. This product is truly amazing.The impressions after wearing this are pleasant and quite positive. Loved it.",5,1

Watch UI is also smooth i didn't find any lags. Not recommended for accurate fitness tracking but it works for the price.Battery life is decent i haven't charged it from when i bought it 3 days ago.For anyone who is looking to purchase a watch with calling and to see notifications can definitely go for it.,5,1

Best smartwatch under 2000,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 12 October 2022,This is one of the best smartwatch in the budget range... Its display is amazing and it is more than efficient for outdoor and indoor use. Its almost very accurate.. As they say in the discription it is not a clinical grade smart watch but it is also almost accurate in heartrate and spo2.. Another thing feel in it amazing is its battery life it gets 8-10 days without bt calling.. And gets upto 2-3 days with bluetooth calling.. I mainly use it for cycling and walking.. It is also water resistant for 5-10 minutes continues dipping in water... I found all the features correct that I read in the description. I didnt expect this much quality and features in it... Its bt calling feature is also amazing according to its price...This product is totally amazing....Thankbyou🙏...,5,1

Nice and cool watch,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 28 July 2022,Watch is really nice and cool...buy on prime day sale. But i return due to battery drain Perticular while using calling function BT calling.Function are good but blood pressure option not available.Overall if you agree to little bit drain of battery problem (bt calling we can use 3 days and without calling 5 days battery backup)then it's surely very good choice if its under 2k.,3,0
