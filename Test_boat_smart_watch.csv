Good choice for a smartwatch with Bluetooth calling feature,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 July 2022,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Was looking for a feature packed smart watch with Bluetooth calling, so ordered this on the launch day on prime day. Got it in good deal and delivered within 24hrs. The watch is slim and light weight, HD display although it's not AMOLED for always on but display shows on waving so saves on battery. Charges with the 2pin magnetic connector. It has step counter, heartbeat monitor(15min interval), SPO2, timer and stopwatch, built-in and custom watch faces and Bluetooth Calling. Responsive touch makes it easy to dial a new number as well without touching my phone.Worth giving it a try, good option for budget gift.It's water resistant, i useed it to make calls in rain and was audible as it has good inbuilt mic and speaker.It's been 3 days I am using and now it does feel like a part of body.",5,

Good product,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 1 August 2022,I have used many smartwatches previously but this is my first one which is having a dial pad and calling feature. I was very excited while trying out it. Very very premium finish has been given to watch. Speaker is properly fitted into it so that you can use it personally for calls and people at distance wont be able to listen. Vital measurements and all other fearures like heart rate and SPO2 also works fine. There are lot of screens to choose from but i will be looking to have a custom wallpaper feature via update that is one thing thats missing but the faces they have provided are also very amazing.,5,

Best Wearable from Boat with a budget price.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 26 July 2022,The smartwatch is amazing. The 1.6 inch large display looks great in outdoors. The most highlighting feature of the watch is it supports Bluetooth calling. U can read notifications also. It also comes with Alexa which works quite well. There are almost 60 health modes and all are useful and highly accurate. There are lot of amazing watch faces which we can choose according to our wish and we can customise the faces too. The 7day battery life is due to its massive 300mah battery. This was my first smartwatch from boat and I must say I loved it. Moreover it's made in india. A very good product by boat. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.,5,

Warranty is useless since none of the service centers pick up calls!,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 10 October 2022,I purchased this smartwatch on 23/07/22 and it worked fine for 2 months. But a few days ago the side button stopped functioning and soon after the watch itself isn't switching on. I tried getting in touch with the service centers mentioned on the Boat website but one is closed permanently and the other two aren't even responding to calls or messages. My suggestion to those reading this would be to shell out around two thousand more and go for a guaranteed product from a showroom instead of going for an online product offering a heavy discount.I have purchased Boat Air Pods in the past and have been happy with the products but I'm very disappointed with Boat this time.,1,
Nice and valuable product.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 September 2022,"Got this for my father for tracking his health parameters and man he loves it, taking calls without reaching for phone has to be his favourite and also health is quite check when you have daily record.

Highly inaccurate measurements,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 16 August 2022,"Writing this review after using the product for over 2 weeks. Never expected such a poor experience from BoAt. It has all the necessary features and the look and feel are perfect. But the accuracy is completely waste. You can talk for 5kms and the watch will show 600mtrs. After doing yoga for over an hour with 25 Suryanamaskars among all it shows 37Cal burned. The bluetooth connectivity is very weak and keeps disconnecting while on call, so calling feature also becomes useless. At times when you are speaking on call the call automatically diverts to the watch speaker and entire office can hear you hear the call. Not sure if this piece is junk or all BoAt watches are.

Not worth it !!!!!  PLEASE STAY AWAY,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 September 2022,"Have brought this during Amazon's dushhera festival sale....To start with, the magnetic charging cable itself was missing from the box....since I had another smartwatch order delivered on the same day and fortunately that had come with the cable, I used it to charge this watch... believe it or not, the watch was already charged to about 95%, which made me circumspect and think that it may be a faulty returned product that has been pushed during festival sale...then came the next shocker.... in spite of hell of an effort I could not make or receive calls over it as the CALL BT with which it needed to pair was visible in none of the 3 phones I tried ...the biggest and worst shocker came when I tried to get replacement for this, the Amazon CC have asked me to wait for 4 days just to investigate the matter and replace the faulty and incomplete product.I am not leaving this untill my problem is resolved.Would write another review once I get the new replacement.Received the replacement today i.e. on 30th October and beleive it or not it doesn't have the DISPLAY AT ALL.PLEASE STAY AWAY",1,

The build quality seems good and perfectly fitted to my hand. The UI is simple to use.Music controlling, Spo2 and so many sports modes are working fine. The battery backup given is 10 days, a good thing while travelling. And the boat wearables app is useful for a better customization of the smartwatch.It’s amazing productDisplay is very niceOverall I simply like this wave call smartwatch and I would suggest who are searching for a budget friendlyBluetooth calling smartwatch, simply go for it.",5,
